# Build a new-api image from this source tree and restart the deployment.
#
# Host layout this assumes, with the script living in the source checkout:
#
#   <root>/new-api/docker-compose.yml          the deployment
#   <root>/new-api-source-code/new-api/        this repository
#
# so the deployment directory is found relative to the script and no absolute
# path is baked in. Override it with --compose-dir.
#
# Two things this exists to prevent:
#
#   The version string is not a label. The Dockerfile bakes `cat VERSION` into
#   common.Version, and VERSION is tracked and empty here, so a plain
#   `docker build` publishes an image that reports no version at all - in the
#   admin UI, in /api/status, and in every bug report made against it. The
#   version is written for the build and the file restored afterwards, so the
#   baked value always matches the tag.
#
#   The deployment must actually reference the image that was just built. The
#   stock compose file pulls calciumion/new-api:latest, so rebuilding a local
#   image and restarting would quietly keep running upstream's. The compose file
#   is checked before anything restarts.
#
#   ./deploy-new-api.sh                          # build, restart, verify
#   ./deploy-new-api.sh --version v1.0.0-fork.1
#   ./deploy-new-api.sh --build-only             # build, do not touch the deployment
#   ./deploy-new-api.sh --no-build               # restart with the current image
#   ./deploy-new-api.sh --push                   # also push to a registry
#   ./deploy-new-api.sh --dry-run
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure, so it is safe to chain in CI or a wrapper.
